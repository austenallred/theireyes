<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>I've always been fascinated by discrepancies of information, the different classes of information we find ourselves plugged into, and how that affects our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.</p>

<p>When I lived in Ukraine and spoke with the older generation there, I was shocked to learn that many of them revered Stalin and Lenin as those born and raised in the United States would revere George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. This was a major shock to my system. To someone who grew up in the US, Stalin and Lenin were usually grouped with Hitler and Mussolini in the history books. This curiosity is one of the reasons I went on to start <a href="https://grasswire.com">Grasswire</a>).</p>

<p>One of the main places I get information today is Twitter. So I wanted to see what Twitter looks like through the eyes of some of the most famous investors and entrepreneurs. I created a list of the people they follow, and find the results fascinating. Using Twitter's API it wasn't difficult to create a site to give everyone a glance without forcing them to go through all the same legwork that I did.</p>

<p>The difficult part was coming up with a list of who to include. I tried looking for a good list, but in the end I just added whoever came to mind. You'll notice obvious groupings (for example, A16Z). That's probably a result of my train of thought; they're not necessarily ranked in order of perceived value.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

The entire site is just Twitter widgets generated from lists.

The lists were generated by scraping everyone followed by the entrepreneur/investor using <a href="http://electoralhq.com">ElectoralHQ</a>.

The result is that you can see exactly what their feed is.
